# hii this is how you will put nongs on the website

### before uploading file pls do this its not like necessary but plssssssss
- file name should be just the song id and nothing else
- put song title and artist in the files properties for people using jukebox (me specifically ik u dont rly care pslpslpsl)

### ok so how 2 put file
1. go in the **nongs folder** in the files on the left side of ur screen
2. in the top right hit the **add file** button and click **upload files**
3. **drag or select file** as it says
4. **in the description** for the change (where it says "add files via upload" by default) pls **put the name of the level** the nong is for i think thats gonna show next to the file

### and how 2 get it on the website
1. in the files on the left **go on the song** you added
2. **right click** on the **"view raw"** link in the middle of the screen
3. **copy the link**
4. go to **script2.js** and **find the level** the song is for
5. **paste the link** you copied in step 3 in **songurl**


o and also if ur adding a level without a nong level the songurl blank

i think thats it gg
